Quick is a popular unit testing framework for Swift and Objective-C. Together with the matcher framework Nimble, it makes unit testing easier than XCTest. In the first tutorial, we will introduce basic knowledges about Quick with examples.

### Installation

We can get the details about installation from the [Installing Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/master/Documentation/en-us/InstallingQuick.md). Using CocoaPods is our favorite and recommendation.

### Add test target for Xcode project

* if you start a new project

* if you have a project already

### Structure

A basic Quick testing file is like

<script src="https://gist.github.com/NilStack/bed1aa592b7ea155090dce176558902e.js"></script>

#### QuickSpec

>  "QuickSpec is a base class all specs written in Quick inherit from."
>  - From Quick Documentation

QuickSpec is subclass of XCTestCase which makes it found and driven by XCTest's mechanism. We need to  inherit QuickSpec and override the only function spec() where we put all our test case in. We'll explain details in coming articles.

#### beforeEach

Like setUp() in XCTestCase, beforeEach is a closure which will be run before each test. We can put all the preparation codes in it

### afterEach

Like tearDown in XCTestCase, afterEach is a closure which will be run after each test. We can put all the tear down codes in it

we will introduce the core definitions like describe, context and it in next article.
