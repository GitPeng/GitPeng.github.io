[ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) is a popular JSON mapping framework in Swift which can be easily used with Realm.  
How easily? Here is code snippet from ObjectMapper's page on GitHub.
   
    class Model: Object, Mappable {
        dynamic var name = ""
        required convenience init?(_ map: Map) {
            self.init()
        }
        func mapping(map: Map) {
            name <- map["name"]
        }
    }

That's all you need to do when y
