In our daily design, we need to convert text layer to vector shape in some case. Then we can work on it as a shape in Sketch. For example, it is easy to transform the a shape along the z-axis but not easy as the text. So

* choose the text layer
* right click to call out the pop menu or select "Layer" in main menu
* select "Convert to Outlines"
* or press the hotkey "Shift-Command-O" directly

we'll get the outlines. If you have many text layers and don't want to convert them one by one, here is an useful plugin [Texts-to-Outlines](https://github.com/zholdas/Texts-to-Outlines). If you're familiar with Sketch plugin development, here is [sample codes](https://github.com/turbobabr/Sketch-Plugins-Cookbook/blob/master/Samples/Convert%20Text%20Layer%20to%20Outlines.sketchplugin) to do this.

That's all for today.
