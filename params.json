{"name":"Pragma.TV","tagline":"Focus on Apple TV development ","body":"## Hello Apple TV!\r\nApple TV is becoming another platform for our developers while Apple announced tvOS and new generation TV device.\r\n\r\nBy convention in developers' world, we will develop a 'Hello Apple TV!' style example.\r\n\r\nFirst please download and install Xcode 7.1 beta from Apple developer page. In the templates for new project, you'll see a new catagory for tvOS. Please select the simple single view application template.\r\n\r\n ![new-project-template](https://db.tt/9WH6auYi)\r\n \r\nThe following steps are same as creating a new iOS applicaton. You will also be very familiar with the generated files.\r\n\r\n ![new-project-files](https://db.tt/YFH8vFvW)\r\n \r\nOk, in the ViewController implementation file, we will add the UI elements and logic. It's very simple to show 'Hello TV!' and the tap gesture on play/pause button of Apple TV Remote controller will change the color of the text.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/NilStack/6d88bb470551f2462f42.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nWe don't use button as usual but a tap gesture because the interacton is very different with iOS even the codes are similiar. We will dig deeper on this topic later.\r\n\r\nBuild and pray!\r\n\r\n ![HelloTV.gif](https://db.tt/GXGS6Y03)\r\n \r\nThe complete project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/NilStack/HelloAppleTV).\r\n \r\n <div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */\r\n        var disqus_shortname = 'developwatch'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname\r\n\r\n        /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */\r\n        (function() {\r\n            var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;\r\n            dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';\r\n            (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);\r\n        })();\r\n </script>\r\n <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>\r\n ","google":"UA-53018207-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
